# Land Cover Classification from Remote Sensing Images Based on Multi-Scale Fully Convolutional Network


In this repository, we design two branches with convolutional layers in different kernel sizes in each layer of the encoder to capture multi-scale features. Besides, a channel attention block and a global pooling module are utilized to enhance channel consistency and global contextual consistency. Substantial experiments are conducted on both 2D RGB images datasets and 3D spatial-temporal datasets.

The detailed results can be seen in the [Land Cover Classification from Remote Sensing Images Based on Multi-Scale Fully Convolutional Network](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10095020.2021.2017237).

The training and testing code can refer to [GeoSeg](https://github.com/rajesh0305/GeoSeg-main).
